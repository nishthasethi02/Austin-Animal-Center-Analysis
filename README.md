# Austin-Animal-Center-Analysis
📌 Austin Animal Center Outcomes
➡️ This project analyzes data from the Austin Animal Center, the largest No-Kill animal shelter in the United States, to derive actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making in animal welfare.

📁 Dataset
The data comes from the publicly available dataset, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/austin-animal-center-outcomes. It includes detailed information about animals entering the shelter, their intake type, medical status, and final outcomes.

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze the success rate of Austin’s No-Kill Policy, study animal outcome types by species, investigate age-wise adoption patterns, examine the impact of neutered, spayed, or intact status, identify seasonal and yearly outcome trends, assess the influence of color and breed on adoptions, and understand how intake conditions affect final outcomes.

🧼 Data Cleaning
The dataset was carefully prepared by handling missing and inconsistent values, standardizing categorical variables, parsing and converting date formats, and removing duplicate records to ensure reliable analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis employed pie charts, stacked bar charts, boxplots, time-series analysis, distribution comparisons, and correlation checks to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the data.

📊 Interactive Dashboard Analysis
Alongside Python-based analysis, an interactive dashboard was developed to provide a unified visual overview of key animal welfare metrics, enabling users to track adoption, transfer, and euthanasia trends over time, analyze outcomes by species, age group, breed, color, and sterilization status, evaluate the effectiveness of the No-Kill Policy through live versus non-live outcome comparisons, and identify seasonal patterns and high-impact factors influencing shelter outcomes.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and datetime were used for analysis, while MS Excel tools such as Power Query, Power Pivot, and advanced data visualization techniques were used to build the interactive dashboard.

🔍 Key Insights
Neutered or spayed animals demonstrated significantly better outcomes, younger animals showed higher adoption rates, breed and color influenced adoption likelihood, seasonal trends revealed adoption surges during specific months, and intake conditions played a critical role in determining final outcomes.

🌍 Why This Project Matters
This project highlights how analytics and visualization can support compassionate, evidence-based decision-making in animal shelters, helping improve adoption outcomes, strengthen No-Kill initiatives, and transform complex data into real-world impact.

🔭 Future Scope
Future enhancements include predictive modeling to forecast outcomes, survival analysis to evaluate shelter stay duration, breed-specific trend analysis, and the development of more advanced and public-facing interactive dashboards.
