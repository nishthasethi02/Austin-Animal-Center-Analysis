# Austin-Animal-Center-Analysis
📌Austin Animal Center Outcomes

➡️ This Project analyzes data from the Austin Animal Center, the largest 'No-Kill' animal shelter in the United States. 

📁 Dataset
The data comes from the publicly available dataset, https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/austin-animal-center-outcomes. It includes detailed information about animals entering the shelter, their intake type, medical status, and final outcomes.

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze the success rate of Austin’s No-Kill Policy
Study animal outcome types by species
Investigate age-wise adoption patterns
Explore the impact of neutered/spayed/intact status
Examine seasonal and yearly outcome trends
Assess the effect of color and breed on adoptions
Understand the impact of intake conditions on final outcomes

🧼 Data Cleaning
Before diving into the analysis, the dataset was thoroughly cleaned:
Handled missing and inconsistent values
Standardized categorical variables
Parsed and converted date formats
Removed duplicates for reliable insights

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To uncover patterns and trends, the following techniques and visualizations were used:
Pie charts, stacked bar charts, and boxplots
Time series analysis
Distribution comparisons
Correlation checks

🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
datetime

🔍 Key Insights
Neutered/spayed animals had significantly better outcomes
Younger animals were adopted at higher rates
Breed and color influenced adoption likelihood
Seasonal trends showed adoption surges in specific months
Intake conditions played a strong role in outcomes

🌍 Why This Project Matters
Animal shelters like Austin Animal Center rely on data to make life-saving decisions. This project shows how data analysis can improve adoption rates, support No-Kill policies, and guide compassionate, data-driven strategies — ultimately turning insights into impact for animal welfare. 

🔭 Future Scope
Predictive Modeling
- Apply machine learning to forecast outcomes using features like age, breed, and neuter status.
Survival Analysis
- Study how long animals stay in the shelter before different outcomes.
Breed-Specific Trends
- Analyze adoption rates, shelter duration, and non-live outcomes by breed.
Interactive Dashboards
- Create dashboards to inform the public, support organizations, and assist volunteers
